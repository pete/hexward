This is a tiny proof-of-concept banged out in an hour after a fun conversation
with Mr. Justin George ( http://github.com/jaggederest ), who had the idea that
an ordered list of words could function much better than a SHA1 but could hold
the same information.  Sort of a look-up, with each word representing n-bits.
It wouldn't need to be a SHA1, though; it could be arbitrary data.  The initial
idea, though, was that if you have a reliable mapping and you make sure that the
reverse-mapping works across machines and versions of the library, then it could
be a much easier to remember way to identify git commits.  Could also work for
IP addresses, SSH-keys, etc., so we're playing around to see if it's workable.
